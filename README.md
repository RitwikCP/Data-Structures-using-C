# Data-Structures-using-C
Repository containing detailed implementations of various data structures, along with that it also contains implementations of various sorting as well as searching techniques, all in C. 

This was all created as part of the algorithms and data structures as part of my undergraduate studies. The repo has been properly organised into seven subfolders, one for implementation of polynomials, linked list, queue, search techniques, sorting techniques, stacks and tree. 
Each of these subfolders contain codes for implementation of different data structures and techniques. 
An effort has been made to include as many as possible for the same. Yet, many more can be added.
